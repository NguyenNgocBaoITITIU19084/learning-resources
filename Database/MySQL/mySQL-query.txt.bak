*****==========================MYSQL QUERY=============================*****
	- SELECT set of column form a table
	- When using the SELECT statement mySQL executing the FORM statement before the SELECT statement
	- SELECT statement does not require the FORM clause
	- Assign an alias to a column to make it more readable
		SYNTAX: 
			SELECT select_list
			FROM table_name;
		
			SELECT 1 + 1 as total;
			
	* ORDER BY CLAUSE
	- To sort the result from the SELECT clause using the ORDER BY
	- ASC standard for ascending 
	- DESC standard for descending
	- By default the ORDER BY using the ASC if you do not specify any option
	- MySQL will execute the FROM -> SELECT -> ORDER BY clause.
	- Result will sort by solumn1 first, then it will sort by column2 base on sorted result of column1
		SYNTAX:
			SELECT select_list
			FROM table_name
			ORDER BY 
			column1 [ASC|DESC], 
			column2 [ASC|DESC],
			...;
		EXAMPLE:
			SELECT 
				orderNumber, 
				orderLineNumber, 
				quantityOrdered * priceEach AS subtotal 
			FROM 
				orderdetails 
			ORDER BY 
				subtotal DESC;
		* Using the MySQL ORDER BY clause to sort data using a custom list
	- The FIELD() function return the index (position) of a value within a list of values
	- The value for which you wanto find the position
	- The value1, value2 is the list of values against which you want compare specific field
	- In ORDER CLAUSE, the NULL value is lower than non-NULL value
		SYNTAX:
			FIELD(value, value1, value2,...)
		EXAMPLE:
			SELECT 
				orderNumber, 
				status 
			FROM orders 
			ORDER BY 
			FIELD(
				status, 
				'In Process', 
				'On Hold', 
				'Cancelled', 
				'Resolved', 
				'Disputed', 
				'Shipped'
			);
	* WHERE CLAUSE:
		- Where clause allow you specify search_condition for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE clause
		- Search_condition is a combination of one or more expressions using the logical operator AND, OR, NOT
		- MYSQL will execute FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> ORDER BY
			SYNTAX:
				SELECT select_list
				FROM table_name
				WHERE search_condition;
			EXAMPLE:
				Select firstName, lastName, officeCode, jobTitle 
				From employees where jobTitle = 'VP Sales' 
				AND 
				officeCode BETWEEN 1 AND 3 
				ORDER BY officeCode
		* Using with comparision operator:
			- Equal to OP, can use with almost datatype = 
			- Not equal to <> or !=
			- Less than <
			- Greater than >
			- Less than or equal <=
			- Greater than or equal >=
	
	* SELECT DISTINCT
		- when you querying data from a table, you may get duplicate rows. To remove duplicate rows
using the SELECT DISTINCT
		- If you specify DISTINCT for the column contains Null-value, DISTINCT will keep only one 
Null-value. Because it consider that all null value are the same
		- MySQL execute FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> DISTINCT -> ORDER BY
		SYNTAX:
			SELECT DISTINCT
				select_list
			FROM 
				table_name
			WHERE 
				search_condition
			ORDER BY 
				sort_expression;
		EXAMPLE:
			SELECT DISTINCT
				state, city
			FROM
				customers
			WHERE
				state IS NOT NULL
			ORDER BY 
				state, 
				city;
	* AND OPERATOR:
	- The AND operator is as logical operator that combines two or more Boolean expressions 
as returns 0,1,null.
	- The AND operator have higher precedence than OR operator
	- The AND operator is short-circuit evaluation. When evaluation an expression that contain the AND
operator, MYSQL will stop evaluating the remaining parts of the expression as soon as it can.
	SELECT 1 = 0 AND 1 / 0;
					TRUE	FALSE	NULL
			TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	NULL
			FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
			NULL	NULL	FALSE	NULL
